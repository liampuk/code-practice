# Coding Practice

This is a repository for tracking coding practice over the years.

## ðŸš€ Leetcode ðŸš€

I have written a leetcode problem generator in typescript/bun. This generates a random set of problems, filtered by difficulty, type etc.

Find the generator and my solutions to problems here: [Leetcode Problem Generator](https://github.com/liampuk/code-practice/tree/master/leetcode)

## ðŸ¦‡ Codingbat ðŸ¦‡

[CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/about.html) is a website set up by Nick Parlante at Stanford as an introduction to programming. I used this website to learn programming at school and practice at university.

You can find my solutions to all the codingbat problems here: [CodingBat Solutions](https://github.com/liampuk/code-practice/tree/master/codingbat)
